# Numerical-analysis-project-1
This is an academic project that helped us(me and my friends) apply the concepts of polynomial interpolation. This was done through the use of a real life problem to apply fundamentals concept of polynomial interpolation and the study of  descripancies  generated by the use of a polynomial function.
